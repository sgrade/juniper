
Temporary solution: 
!!! Content of Rec2_on_vr.conf duplicates the same content in Rec2-vr.conf - delete relevant part of the config.

The ..._on_vr.conf created manually from related conf files. Create logical systems for them, then manually load configs to the related logical system. For example:

copy the config to the clipboard (e.g. with Ctrl+C)
edit logical system Rec1
load merge relative terminal
paste the config from the clipboard (e.g. with the Ctrl+V)
Ctrl+D
commit
